# Advent of Code 2023
Tackling Advent of Code with Kotlin.

## Branches
This repository is split into two primary branches:
### main
This branch contains the advent of code problems and any domain objects and parsing logic required to start solving a given problem (unless the entire problem is just a parsing one e.g. day 1).

Tests are pre-populated using the provided examples from the day's prompt.  Note that the function return types might be more verbose than is required to answer the question and more detailed testing will take place to make solving the problem easier.

### solutions
This branch contains my own solutions to each day's problem.
